## Contribute

Creating a scenery in Microsoft Flight Simulator is a lot of work. That's why I am happy to share the "source code" of this scenery on Github. If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork the project. It would be great if you could open an issue here and assign it to you so no one else is working on the same topic.

## Default Scenery

In the default scenery of Microsoft Flight Simulator EDDS - Stuttgart Airport is missing.
